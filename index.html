<p class="p">Several <b>Star Wars</b> films have been produced separately from the Skywalker Saga. In 2008, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a> released the animated film The Clone Wars, which is set during the prequel trilogy and serves as the theatrical pilot of the television series of the same name. Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, an "anthology" film series set between the main episodes of the Skywalker Saga entered development in parallel with the production of the sequel trilogy, described by <a href="https://www.disney.com">Disney</a>
 chief financial officer Jay Rasulo as origin stories.</p>
